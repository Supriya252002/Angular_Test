# AngularTest
This repository showcases my implementation of an Angular test, demonstrating proficiency in Angular development and web application design. The repository includes several completed tasks as specified in the test requirements.

Task-1:-The user should be able to navigate between Home, Create User, and User Listing routes. The User Listing route should display 10 cards, each containing titles and images fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
